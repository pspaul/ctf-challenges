## Description
Your day at the arcade was long and exhausting, so you go to the bar across the street. You've never been there before and the first impression is kinda odd. Which bar lets you mix your order yourself? And there's this drink they don't want to serve you... Unfortunately, you don't like anything else from the menu, but you will surely find a way to get your favourite drink!
